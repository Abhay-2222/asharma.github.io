								<ul>Community Events: Include a section within the app that highlights upcoming community events, such as guided tours, nature walks, or workshops happening near the trail. Users can stay informed and actively participate in local activities.<br /> <br /> <br />
									Informative Chronological Maps: Provide users with informative and interactive maps that showcase the trail's historical development over time. Users can navigate through different eras and learn about significant milestones or changes that have occurred along the trail.<br /> <br /> <br />
									Panels Leading to Interactive Visuals: Install physical panels at specific points along the trail, each featuring a marker that users can scan with the app. Upon scanning, interactive visuals, such as 3D models, videos, or animations, can be displayed, offering additional information or stories related to that particular location. <br /> <br /> <br />
									Rewards and Incentives Based on Distance Covered: Gamify the trail experience by incorporating rewards and incentives based on the distance covered. Users can earn badges, virtual collectibles, or unlock exclusive content as they progress along the trail, encouraging exploration and engagement.<br /> <br /> <br />
									Photo Filters: Enhance the user experience by integrating AR photo filters that users can apply to their trail photos. These filters can be themed around the natural beauty of the surroundings or historical elements, adding a fun and creative element to capturing memories on the trail.</ul>
									<h2>Wireframes and Prototype</h2>
