                         <h3>Dundas</h3>
                                    <p>Dundas is a community tucked beneath the Niagara Escarpment in Southern Ontario, Canada. It became incorporated as a town on July 28, 1847, and remained a distinct municipality until its amalgamation with the City of Hamilton on January 1, 2001. The Community of Dundas today, with its picturesque downtown, heritage homes, and tree-lined streets, has become the arts and cultural heart of the area</p>
                                    <h3>Dundas Museum</h3>
									<p>The Dundas Museum & Archives has been a unifying force since its inception, bringing people together to appreciate and understand our rich heritage. With a focus on the Dundas Valley's history and geography, our collections, exhibits, and events offer a glimpse into the unfolding of our unique region.
